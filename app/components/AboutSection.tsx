            The TSU Postgraduate Admissions Guide was created to support aspiring
            postgraduate applicants in navigating the often complex admission
            process. Our mission is to provide a central source of truth where
            candidates can access verified information about PGD, MSc, and PhD
            programmes, application procedures, and key academic updates.
